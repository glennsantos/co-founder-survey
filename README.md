### Roles

* What would you want your role to be? (e.g. CEO/CTO/COO/etc.)
* What would you want your role to be, before we reach product market fit (PMF)?
* What would you want your role to be, once we reach PMF?
* What would you want your role to be, we start to really scale?
* If your role becomes unavailable (e.g. the board hires a professional CEO), what would you want your new role to be?

* What are the key areas of responsibility (AORs) for the CEO? 
* What are the AORs for the CTO?
* What are the AORs for the COO/CPO/etc.?

#### Areas of Responsibility Exercise:
1. Rank yourself in these areas (both as an IC, and as a leader) on a scale of 1-10:
  * sales
  * marketing
  * product
  * design
  * engineering
  * operations
  * fundraising
  * being a leader
  * company building
  * recruiting
  * legal
  * company specific skills (e.g. healthcare, ML)

2. Rate your passion in each of the above areas on a scale of none to high. (e.g. I'm an 8 in sales, but hate it now).
3. Cluster AORs based on rank, discuss, and assign to individuals. (John is a 10 in Product and gets that AOR).
4. Break ties using the passion rating. (e.g. Nick is a 7 in Sales with medium passion and Gloria is a 7 in Sales with high passion)
5. **Discuss:** do these clusters align with everyones expectations, skills, and desires?
